[Tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com/) is used as an example to testing specific feature on it.

## User Story
Many User are positive about the online shop approach, not only that the user can find the items that the user want, but also can do some research about the quality, price, warranty information, and additional benefit on it. In some cases, When the User find the item that they want to buy after took some time to do research, they did not straight up purchase at that time, its because that they do some planning to buy it later. The pain point is if User to do so, they have to memorize what the item that they want to buy, which merchant is selling that item.
